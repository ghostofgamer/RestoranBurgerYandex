# SimpleJSON for Unity

## Description

This is wrapper around the awesome [SimpleJSON](https://github.com/Bunny83/SimpleJSON) library originally developed by Markus GÃ¶bel. This is required for most of my Unity packages. Until there is an official SimpleJSON Unity package, I decided to create this wrapper, so SimpleJSON can be marked as a dependency in my packages. If you have any questions or issues with SimpleJSON, please refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/Bunny83/SimpleJSON).
